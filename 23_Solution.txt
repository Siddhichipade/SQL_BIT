You are given a ‘Students’ table consisting of Id,Name and marks of two tests namely Marks1 and Marks2. The teacher wants to sort the table based on their marks(in descending order). However the teacher has a particular hate towards students whose Names starts with a vowel. Therefore the teacher would take the maximum of the two tests for students whose name doesn’t start with a vowel while sorting, and would take the minimum of the two tests for the students whose name starts with a vowel while sorting.

Solution:
SELECT Name
FROM Students
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN LEFT(Name, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') THEN LEAST(Marks1, Marks2)
        ELSE GREATEST(Marks1, Marks2)
    END DESC;
