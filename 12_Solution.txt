Write a SQL Query to find the name of those movies where one or more actors acted in two or more movies.

Output Schema:

movie_title
NOTE:

Output column name has to match the given output schema.
Any name is the concatenation(without any delimiter) of first and last name if present
(E.g. if director_first_name is ‘Alfred’ and director_last_name is ‘Hitchcock’ then director_name is ‘AlfredHitchcock’)
Example Output:

movie_title
Vertigo

Solution:
SELECT DISTINCT m.movie_title
FROM movies m
JOIN movies_cast mc ON m.movie_id = mc.movie_id
WHERE mc.actor_id IN (
    SELECT actor_id
    FROM movies_cast
    GROUP BY actor_id
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT movie_id) >= 2
);
