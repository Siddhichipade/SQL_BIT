Given 2 tables EMPLOYEE and EVALUATION, build a report containing the 2 columns, Name and Rating. Employees with Ratings less than 6 should appear as NULL in the table. The entries in the table should be sorted by descending order of Rating, followed by Names in lexicographic order. 
NOTE : The output should contain 2 columns by the name ‘Names’ and ‘Rating’.

Solution:
SELECT CASE
    WHEN EVALUATION.Rating >= 6 THEN EMPLOYEE.Name
    ELSE NULL
    END AS Names, EVALUATION.Rating
FROM EMPLOYEE INNER JOIN EVALUATION ON EMPLOYEE.Points BETWEEN EVALUATION.Lower AND EVALUATION.Upper
ORDER BY EVALUATION.Rating DESC, Names ASC;
